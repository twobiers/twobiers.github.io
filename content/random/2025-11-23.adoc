= Hello from AsciiDoc
:icons: font


Hello, World!

This blog now supports AsciiDoc content via the https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] toolchain.
Syntax highlighting is provided by https://github.com/twobiers/asciidoctor-chroma[Asciidoctor Chroma], which integrates seamlessly with this setup.

== Code Examples

Here's a Python function demonstrating basic syntax:

[source,python]
----
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return result

print(fibonacci(10))
----

== Advanced Features

AsciiDoc supports various features:

* *Bold* and _italic_ text
* Inline `code snippets`
* Tables, admonitions, and more

Here's a Java example with exception handling:

[source,java]
----
public class DataProcessor {
    public static void processData(String[] args) throws IOException {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line.toUpperCase());
            }
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
----

What isn't working yet (and I know of - its most likely more):

* Admonitions styling is missing
* Callouts in code blocks are not rendered
