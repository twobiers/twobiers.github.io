In GitHub Actions it's possible to remove all permissions from the token at the workflow level and then assign them on the job level:

```yaml
name: Release
permissions: {} # No permissions

on: 
  push: 
    branches: 
    - main 
jobs:
  release:
    permissions: 
      contents: write
      packages: write
      id-token: write
```
